    <h1 class="blogH1">Week 07 | Google Ads & Keywords</h1>
    <h2 class="blogH2">By BriAnna Marsh</h2>
    <p class="blogPost">I really enjoyed this week. Search engine optimization is something that’s always intrigued me,
        and I feel like we’re starting to dip our toes into that subject. Keywords are crucial to making sure our
        advertisements are going to the right people at the right time. It’s important to have a mix of both broad and
        specific terms that are pertinent to the service or product. This will ensure we can find customer’s looking for
        very specific items as well as people who are broadly searching for things related to a subject. Google ads seem
        like a great way to accomplish this. It’s the most widely used search engine with the biggest potential for an
        audience. They’ve already created and implemented the tools throughout the engine and while the ads are
        noticeable, they aren’t in your face or annoying. I also like that I can have Google ads automatically place
        bids for me. I understand that it may not be the most optimized but as someone without a ton of experience in
        advertising I believe it’s my easiest and least stressful option. Overall, I like where my business is going!
