    <h2 class="blogH2">By BriAnna Marsh</h2>
    <p class="blogPost">I think my business has good potential for social media marketing. I originally was inspired by
        the small artist community on Twitter and if I can use my site to feature and promote other artists hopefully, I
        can join the cycle and receive some support myself. I don’t believe social networking can impact my business
        directly, but I could use some pointers in advertising and creating a flourishing business. I think everyone can
        use a little push in those areas no matter how big their business is. Overall, my ads didn’t do so hot, I
        improved from 5 to 7 clicks and reduced the cost of each click which was great but if I wanted to really go hard
        on an online business there’s still a lot of room for improvement. I took this class to learn these skills and
        oh boy have I learned a lot; this semester has been great. I don’t have the time or money currently as I am
        trying to get through school while working two jobs but down the line, I could see this becoming an option for
        me and I’m super grateful for all I’ve learned even if the stats didn’t come out very pretty.
