    <p class="blogPost">Ads are something I learned a little bit about in a visual design class. That class’s emphasis
        was on the visual part of course but we did learn a little about typography and the wording of ads. So, while
        this wasn’t completely new to me, I did get to learn a lot more about the text aspect. It’s a lot more difficult
        to get your ad to stand out with only text as opposed to interesting visuals. I think I’ve got my options in a
        good spot. Since my business is called Wholesome Happiness, I did my best to incorporate happiness, smiles, and
        similar words into my ad options. These broad keywords were mixed into a paragraph explaining that my site
        features small artists and interesting products that made me happy and might bring joy to someone else. I am
        struggling a little bit as my theme is very broad but as I collect more interesting artists and affiliate
        businesses I am finding better keywords and things are getting easier.
