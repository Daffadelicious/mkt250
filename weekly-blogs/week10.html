    <h2 class="blogH2">By BriAnna Marsh</h2>
    <p class="blogPost">I started up my ad campaign this week, but I’ll admit it was pretty stressful for me. I had
        everything prepared but the free coupon which I wanted to add before starting the payment. The video guide was
        especially outdated on this part and nothing I could find through googling had viable codes. WordPress promises
        to match payments but I’m still having to shill out more than I want to which is disappointing. Other than that,
        things are going well. I especially enjoyed the midweek activity where we improved a different businesses’
        keywords, and ads and got to see their statistics. It was a little trickier figuring out what was performing
        well and what wasn’t. Some things had the same price per click but didn’t lead to nearly as many interactions or
        conversions. I’m excited for when I have a little more data and can do the same for mine.
