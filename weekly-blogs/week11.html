    <h2 class="blogH2">By BriAnna Marsh</h2>
    <p class="blogPost">Search engine optimization has always been an interest of mine as a student in Web Development,
        so I was really excited to dip my toes into the topic this week. A mistake I’ve realized I make is focusing on
        tags to be only read by humans. I’ve used descriptive titles or alts that do represent or describe the page but
        I’ve been looking at it like an English student where I’ve switched words up so they aren’t boring and keep
        things interesting. I’m realizing that its important to reiterate more, yes the repetition may not be the most
        fascinating thing but it’s important that users immediately get something with the keyword from an ad they
        clicked on. It’s also important so that the algorithm can quickly and easily get the important information and
        verify my site as trustworthy in its delivery of the promised content. I’ve gone through and adjusted mostly
        titles and alts on my images and I’m hoping the work pays off.
