    <h1 class="blogH1">Week 13 | Link Building & Social Analytics</h1>
    <h2 class="blogH2">By BriAnna Marsh</h2>
    <p class="blogPost">I really enjoyed this week’s content. I can see how strengthening link building can be and once
        I have proper time, I’d love to invest some of it into link building through social media and supporting other
        small businesses. As for the google analytics section this week, it was so fascinating seeing a real example of
        Google’s merchandise website and how it performed back in 2017. With that amount of data, it’s easy to see why
        Google Analytics is such an important and helpful tool for a business. At this point I’m not sure what it can’t
        tell you about patterns, users, and transactions. It’s a little scary to know that this is the kind of data
        collection they’ve made public to us. I can’t even imagine what sort of in-house collection system they have. As
        useful of a tool as it can be, it also makes me very wary about what kind of information I could be putting out
        there about myself without even realizing it.
