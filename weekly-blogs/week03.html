    <h1 class="blogH1">Week 03 | Sourcing the product</h1>
    <h2 class="blogH2">By BriAnna Marsh</h2>
    <p class="blogPost">This week was very insightful for me. Something I've noticed over the years is that customers are starting 
        to become more and more aware of where their purchased products are being produced from. It's interesting 
        to see discussions on things like fast fashion, vegan, or animal cruelty free production is becoming more 
        and more prominent especially in the beauty industry. While I'm personally all for these strides I can see 
        it shutting out new people and ideas they could bring to different industries due to the accelerated cost 
        of production when those extra steps are taken. Joe's group is inexperienced and low on funds and time which
         was the biggest thing I took into consideration while choosing a manufacturer and deciding between 
         affiliate and drop shipping. With the rate that society is moving towards these more expensive but better 
         sourced products I can't help but feel like this group would have a difficult time getting their business 
         off the ground unless they pour more money into ethically sourced products. It feels like cheaply sourced 
         goods might become a thing of the past here in the future. That aside, I think stepping away from 
         manufacturing and focusing on an affiliate link would be best for their situation. It's a way for them 
         to dip their feet into the pool of an online business without jumping straight into the deep end and 
         biting off more than they can chew. My thought process is that they could learn how to create a proper 
         website and get some good traffic going to it. Then, once they've mastered that they can jump into drop 
         shipping or any other more risky but more profitable business model. Overall, I enjoyed this week of class 
         and I feel like I learned a lot!</p>
