    <h1 class="blogH1">Week 04 | Site builder & Hosting</h1>
    <h2 class="blogH2">By BriAnna Marsh</h2>
    <p class="blogPost">Site building is my bread and butter! I am currently majoring in Web Development and I
        absolutely love it. This is the part of the class that I am most proficient in so hopefully my skills here can
        make up for my lack of business experience. As for site builders, I am most familiar with building sites from
        raw HTML but I've also used WordPress in the past. For this class, I am going to go with DreamWeaver since I
        think it looks like a very cool tool and so that I can continue to learn something new in Web Development. As
        for my host, I will use BlueHost. They have a reasonable price at $2.95 a month for a yearly commitment. Some of
        the other features they offer is matching $150 for google ads and allowing you to track google analytics. They
        offer 24/7 support by email or phone and they are compatible with DreamWeaver which is everything I could ask
        for. I haven't had very many public websites so I'm very excited to see how this turns out and hopefully it will
        be successful!
