    <h1 class="blogH1">Week 09 | Relevance and Quality Score</h1>
    <h2 class="blogH2">By BriAnna Marsh</h2>
    <p class="blogPost">So far in my ad campaign I’ve just received an average score. Since I’m new and haven’t given it
        as much time as I’d like I think that’s decent. I added 20 or so keywords and created tons of headline options
        with each containing at lest one keyword. I’m also proud of my descriptions as they convey a happy welcoming
        message with a simple and non-pressuring call to action. I think the best way to improve my score will be adding
        more niche keywords once I get more affiliate and artist links onto my site. I’m hoping my ad will do well, I
        already noticed I had 15 or so people view my site before making the ad so that should be a good sign. I’ll see
        how it performs and scores then go from there. This week was a little frustrating, I felt Google’s own tutorials
        were out of date, so I had to find different resources or figure it out on my own but in the end, I was able to
        figure out how to create and connect everything. I accomplished what I needed to despite its difficulty and I’m
        looking forward to seeing how it pays off score wise.
