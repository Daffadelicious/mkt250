    <h1 class="blogH1">Week 06 | Legal Structure</h1>
    <h2 class="blogH2">By BriAnna Marsh</h2>
    <p class="blogPost">This week was one of the most nerve wracking. I am majoring in web development; all this
        business stuff is not my forte and it's made me nervous. So nervous in fact, I've decided to change course
        completely. Originally, I wanted to offer my services creating websites for others, but I don't have the time,
        money, or brain power to circumnavigate the legality of all this. I understand the benefits and the reasons
        behind registering yourself as a sole proprietor or an LLC, but I just don't want to get myself into trouble
        legally if something goes south as I don't feel I have the time to properly research and commit fully.

    <p class="blogPost">Instead, I am going to go the affiliate route. I am going to create a site centered around just
        nice wholesome and happy things I can find across the internet. It will only be a business through affiliate
        links which are much easier for me to navigate. All I'll need to do is fill out a W9 form for the company and
        make sure it's marked in my taxes. I can do that! In addition, I have a lot of small artists I would love to
        feature on the site along with those bigger affiliate businesses. Overall, I just want to end up with something
        cute and nice that people can use to get a break from the internet and find something wholesome. I'm also
        considering sharing happy news stories or moments from people on social media though I'm not 100% set on that.
