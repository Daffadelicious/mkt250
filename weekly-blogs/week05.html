    <h2 class="blogH2">By BriAnna Marsh</h2>
    <p class="blogPost">I'm glad we got to get into site design this week, it's one of my favorite topics!
        I'm going to go a modern blocky and cell shaded look for my site which will hopefully give off a professional
        but engaging look that others will find appealing. I am still offering my services for building others sites
        and I want to show off my skills and some fun examples but I will save those for a portfolio page as opposed
        to overwhelming users right away. As for the paypal button we looked at, this is something
        completely new to me and I'm a little nervous about it. I know there's some legal requirements behind it
        and I'm just hoping I can navigate everything properly without getting into trouble. I also need to look
        a little more into it and see how much I can personally style the payment button while still following
        the guidelines set in place. I also included the button here on this page.
